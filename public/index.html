            <p style="text-align: center;"> Welcome to my site! I'm lunacytie. I made this site simply out of pure fun after stumbling upon a neocities site.
You can find anything that interests me or things I created. Follow me on <a href="https://neocities.org/site/lunacytie">neocities</a> of you wanna keep up with what I do on here. 
At the moment the site is very much under construction and might heavily change! 
</p>
<h2
style="text-align: center;">Plans for this site</h2>
<p>Here is a list of things I want to add to this site! </p>
<ul>
    <li>Art Gallery</li>

    <li>OC Overview</li>
    <li>Uses</li>
    <li>Shrines</li>

    <li>Resources</li>
</ul>
    <p> I mainly wanted to make this site to show off my OCs all in one place. And while there are sites for exactly this purpose I don't really like any of them. </p>
    <p>I also love how people just share their interests on their sites, so I'll definitely want to get into that as well. </p>        

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Where  else to find me</h2>
